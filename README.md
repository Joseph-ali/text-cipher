# text-cipher
A simple program that has a collection of cipher to encode and decode a plain text

I used c++ and Qt creator for the program.

I am a new programmer, and I'm trying to learn by making projects. The code may be bad, but I try to make it better in time.
The program has a collection of ciphers to encode and decode. There is only transposition cipher I will add more while learning more ciphers.
I am planing to remove the "Text Files Ciphering" and add tabs for types of ciphers, so it just deals with text with average length. I will also add a mini window inside the main window to demonstraight how the ciphers work.
